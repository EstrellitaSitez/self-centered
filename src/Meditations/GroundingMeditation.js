// 3 minute body scan --> BODY SCAN --> ground our body by acknowledging the physical sensations surrounding our body parts
// Add a fricken back button to each meditation
// breathe into your body parts (bigger ones) /dissolve your smaller body parts as you scan them 
// notice where in our bodies we feel tension/ discomfort

// notice belly rise and fall
// notice heart beat 
//And now, let your attention to expand out to include the entire body as a whole. Bring into your awareness the top of your head down to the bottom of your toes.
